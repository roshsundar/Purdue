This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE 362 (Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing) course at purdue, under professor Rogers in Fall 2022.
The microcontroller used is the STM32. The code used to program the STM32 is assembly and C.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to a lab in the course, and usually contains:
- a readme in the form of a .html file
- a main file that contains code written by me, either main.s (if assembly) or main.c (if C)
- many peripheral files that contain project data, setup, code headers, etc. These were provided by the instructor

Reference manuals for STM32 are STM32F091xBC.pdf and STM32F0x1_Family_Reference.pdf

A rough summary is given below for each lab, see the appropriate .html readme for details:
- Lab 0.2 (/Lab0.2): Environment setup
- Lab 1 (/f2022-lab-1-main): Intro to assembly
- Lab 2 (/Lab_2_Student): Control flow and C-to-assembly
- Lab 3 (/Lab_3_Student): Functions in assembly
- Lab 4 (/f2022-lab-4-main): Computer organization
- Lab 5 (/f2022-lab-5-main): General purpose I/O
- Lab 6 (/f2022-lab-6-main): Interrupts
- Lab 7 (/f2022-lab-7-main): Timers
- Lab 8 (/f2022-lab-8-main): Analog I/O
- Lab 9 (/f2022-lab-9-main): PWM
- Lab 10 (/f2022-lab-10-main): SPI & DMA
- Lab 11 (/f2022-lab-11-main): UART
