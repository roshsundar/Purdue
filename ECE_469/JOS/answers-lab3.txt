Exercise4 Q1:
If all interrupts/exceptions used the same handler, it would not be guaranteed to have kernel protection.
Some handler functions should not be invoked by the user, as that would cause interference with the normal kernel operation.
Some should be allowed to be accessed by the user. Thus, each exception/interrupt should have its own handler in order to have appropriate privilege.

Exercise4 Q2:
The softint program behaved correctly as is. int $14 produces interrupt vector 13 because interrupt vector 14 has kernel privledge level, and cannot be invoked by a user program. 
If the user privlege level could trigger a page fault that the kernel doesn't expect, it could cause unexpected behavior.
