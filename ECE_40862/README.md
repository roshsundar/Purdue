This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE 40862 (Software for Embedded Systems) course at purdue, under professor Su in Fall 2023.
The microcontroller used is the ESP32. The code used to program the ESP32 is Micropython.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to a lab in the course, and usually contains:
- A description of the lab in the form of a .pdf file
- Micropython code files
- a README.txt with some further details of implementation

A rough summary is given below for each lab, see the appropriate .html readme for details:
- Lab 1 (/f2022-lab-1-main): Introduction to Python and Digital Input and Output using GPIOs
- Lab 2 (/Lab_2_Student): LED control using ADC, PWM, Timers and Interrupts
- Lab 3 (/Lab_3_Student): Wi-Fi Networking, Touch Pad Inputs, and Sleep/Wake-Up
- Lab 4 (/f2022-lab-4-main): A Simple IoT Application using an ESP32-based HTTP Web
Server and Client
- Lab 5 (/f2022-lab-5-main): Real-Time Motion Detection System using ESP32,
ThingSpeak and IFTTT
