Background\n","In this assignment, we are trying to do simple sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. It’s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.\n","\n","The dataset we will be using is called [***Stanford Sentiment Treebank***](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html). This dataset is collected from movie reviews on *Rotten Tomatoes* for over 20k sentences. All reviews later got re-organized as distinct phrases with label as number 0.0 to 1.0. Labels can later be divided in to five intervals [0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8], (0.8, 1.0] which means very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive, respectively.\n","\n","The dataset we are using in this assignment is a subset of Stanford Sentiment Treebank and consists of **400 phrases**. Train-test dataset split ratio is 50/50 and for either train or test dataset, half of them are extremely positive reviews (have corresponding range (0.9, 1.0]), and the other half are extremely negative reviews (have corresponding range [0.0, 0.1]). Your job is to construct a simple function that takes a single phrase in and outputs whether this phrase has positive or negative sentiment. You can inspect the training dataset to understand the types of phrases that are used.\n","\n","**The goal of this assignment is to attempt to implement a method from the 1st wave of AI, namely handcrafted knowledge systems. Thus, you will be trying to create a rule-based function for this task based on your prior knowledge and some examples from the training dataset.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IuRq9xvxNoX4"},"source":["## 2.
