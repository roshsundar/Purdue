This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE 57000 (Artifical Intelligence) course at purdue, under professor Inouye in Fall 2023. Google Colab was used as the platform with python notebooks used to run code.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to an assignment in the course, and usually contains:
- A Exercise.ipynb file that typically contains both instructions and code implementation
- Occasionally the instructions will be in a separate .ipynb file

A rough summary is given below for each lab, see the appropriate .ipynb file for details:
- Assignment 1: Intro to AI through Handcrafed knowledge
- Assignment 2: Intro to Python AI tools & PCA
- Assignment 3: Data proceessing & KNN
- Assignment 4: Gradient Descent
- Assignment 5: CNN classification
- Assignemnt 6: RNN model to predict the next character in a sequence of text data from Shakespeare's plays
- Assignment 7: Implement and test different transformer components
- Assignment 8: Latent Representations with KNN
- Assignment 11: DCGAN & WGAN implementation
