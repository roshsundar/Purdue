This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE 57000 (Artifical Intelligence) course at purdue, under professor Inouye in Fall 2023. Google Colab was used as the platform with python notebooks used to run code.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to an assignment in the course, and usually contains:
- A Exercise.ipynb file that typically contains both instructions and code implementation
- Occasionally the instructions will be in a separate .ipynb file

A rough summary is given below for each lab, see the appropriate .ipynb file for details:
- Assignment 1: Intro to AI through Handcrafed knowledge
- Assignment 2: Intro to Python AI tools & PCA
- Assignment 3: Data proceessing & KNN
- Assignment 4: Gradient Descent
- Assignment 5: CNN classification
- Assignemnt 6: RNN model to predict the next character in a sequence of text data from Shakespeare's plays
- Assignment 7: Implement and test different transformer components
- Assignment 8: Latent Representations with KNN
- Assignment 11: DCGAN & WGAN implementation

The Project folder contains the final course project. The project aims to introduce the AI/ML research landscape and help you dive deeper
into a topic of your choice (as the lecture content is necessarily narrow). The project aims to emulate the research paper publishing process including literature review, paper writing, implementation, presentation, and peer reviews. The final product is a paper that consists of 3 reviews of papers in the topic area, and one section for an implementation/extension of one or more of the papers.

The Project folder contains a .pdf file of the paper, as well as .py files containing implementation code. A README is present to explain further details.
