# Final Project
## Due: 12/11/2022 11:59pm ET

Up until now, we have given you fairly detailed instructions for how to design data analyses to answer specific questions about data -- in particular, how to set up a particular analysis and what steps to take to run it. In this project, you will put that knowledge to use!

Put yourself in the shoes of a data scientist being given a data set and asked to draw conclusions from it. Your job will be to understand what the data is showing you, design the analyses you need, justify those choices, draw conclusions from running the analyses, and explain why they do (or do not) make sense.

We are deliberately not giving you detailed directions on how to solve these problems, but feel free to come to office hours to brainstorm.

## Partners

On this project **you may work with one partner**. Working with a partner is optional, and working with a partner will not impact how the project is graded. If you want to work with a partner, it is your responsibility to pair up; feel free to use Piazza's "Search for Teammates" feature (https://piazza.com/class/ky202w8tbhxbw?cid=5) to facilitate this.

If you are working with a partner, _you must share a repository_. This means that one of you will clone your repository on GitHub classroom, and the other will join this team (rather than cloning a second repository). When you go through the normal steps for cloning your repository you will have an opportunity to join an existing team (i.e., your partner has already created a group) or create a new team (i.e., your partner hasn't set up their repository yet).

_If you plan to team up with someone who has already cloned their repository, it is very important that you follow these instructions to join their team, rather than creating a new repository._

If you are working as a team and you are the team leader, you must fill out this form (https://forms.gle/TcKScvY8xCk9gjjs7). 

## Path 1: Bike traffic

The `NYC_Bicycle_Counts_2016_Corrected.csv` gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:

1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day? 
3. Can you use this data to predict what *day* (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?

## What to turn in
You must turn in two sets of files, by pushing them to your team's Github repository. For the report PDF, you have to turn it in to the **Gradescope** as well:

* `report.pdf`: A project report, which should consist of:
  * A section with the names of the team members (maximum of two), your Purdue username(s), and the path (1 or 2 or 3) you have taken.
  * A section describing the dataset you are working with.
  * A section describing the analyses you chose to use for each analysis question (with a paragraph or two justifying why you chose that analysis and what you expect the analysis to tell you).
  * A section (or more) describing the results of each analysis, and what your answers to the questions are based on your results. Visual aids are helpful here, if necessary to back up your conclusions. Note that it is OK if you do not get "positive" answers from your analysis, but you must explain why that might be.

* All Python `.py` code files you wrote to complete the analysis steps.
