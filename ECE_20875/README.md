This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE 20875 (Python for Data Science) course at purdue, under professor Ghasemi in Fall 2022.
The code is python as this is a python based course.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to an assignment in the course, and usually contains:
- a readme
- python code files
- sometimes data/inputs used by python files

See each folder's readme for a detailed description of that assignment.
