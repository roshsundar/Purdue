This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE368 (algorithms and datastructures) course at purdue, under professor Koh in Spring 2022.
The code is mostly C as this is a C based course.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to a project in the course, and usually contains:
  - A project description pdf / readme
  - Sample inputs and outputs
  - Code
  - Autograder results/feedback

A rough summary is given below for each project, see the appropriate readme for details:
  - PA1: perform shell sorting on an array and linked list.

  - PA2: perform huffman decoding on a huffman-encoded file.

  - PA3: a tree is used to represent 2d rectangular box packing. Use the tree to calculate coords and dimensions of boxes

  - PA4: given a tree like in PA3, calculate dimensions of boxes using every possible representation/packing of that tree.
  
  PA5: given a grid of costs, use dijsktras algorithm to find fastest path from top of grid to bottom.
    - PA5_minheap_slow: implementation 1, not submitted. Implementation of dijsktra with minheap as queue.
    - PA5_pq_fast: implementation 2, submitted. Implementation of dijsktra with linked list as queue.
  
  - REPA1: resubmission of PA1. Optimized shell sort on linked list.
 
  - REPA3: resubmission of PA3. Optimized calculation algorithm.
 
  - REPA4: resubmission of PA4. Optimized calculation algorithm and rerooting.
