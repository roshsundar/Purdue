Question: Which which layers are used for the sections of the supply rings?
	metal1, metal2

Question: What are the widths of the supply ring bars and their spacing?
	bar = 10, spacing = 10

Question: What is the spacing between the inner supply ring and the core area, and which prior command
controls this?
	spacing = 10, supply_rings.tcl


Question: How did the layout change after running the ’place_cells.tcl’ script?
	core area filled

Question: What is a rough estimate of the core utilization based on the cells?
	70%

Question: How did the layout change after running the ’sroute’ command?
	cells connected to supply rings

Question: In what ways are the three metal layers typically used in the routing?
	metal1 (blue) = connects to power, gnd
	metal2 (red) = originates at cells, connects to metal3 vertically
	metal3 (green) = horizontally connects metal2 lines

Question: What percentage of the core appears to be filled with cells after running ’final_route.tcl’? And which
command do you think primarily resulted in the change?
	95%. pre_cts_opt.tcl sets density
