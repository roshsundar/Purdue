This folder contains code completed as a part of the ECE 337 (ASIC Design Laboratory) course at purdue, under professor Johnson in Spring 2023.
Verilog/SystemVerilog was used as the hardware development language.

A typical folder in this repository is equivalent to a lab in the course, and usually contains:
- A .pdf manual that containts detailed information about the lab
- A '/source' folder that contains verilog source code
- A makefile that allows the code to be compiled and synthesized
- Many other peripheral files

A rough summary is given below for each lab, see the appropriate .pdf manual for details:
- Lab 1 (/Lab1): Introduction to Verilog and Design Flow Tutorial
- Lab 2 (/Lab2): Introduction to Verilog Coding Styles, Scalable Logic Design, and Exhaustive Testing
- Lab 3 (/Lab3): Introduction to Synthesis Tuning, Structured Debugging, and Non-Exhaustive Testing
- Lab 4 (/Lab4): Simple Sequential Logic Design and Verification
- Lab 5 (/Lab5): Serial Communication Basics, FSM Design, and Data Streaming based Testing
- Lab 6 (/Lab6): Introduction to Serial Communication Protocols (Designing a UART Receiver)
- Lab 7 (/Lab7): Math Algorithms in Hardware (Convolution & FIR Filter Design)
- Lab 8 (/Lab8): Introduction to System-on-Chip Bus Protocols (APB-Slave UART Receiver SoC Peripheral)
- Lab 9 (/Lab9): Pipelined SoC Bus Protocols (AHB-Lite FIR Filter Accelerator)
- Lab 10 (/Lab10): IC Layout Tutorial and Area Tuning
- Lab 11 (/Lab11): IC Layout Process Analysis and Critical Timing Tuning
- Cooperative Design Lab (/ECE337_CDL): team-based, and has its own readme (see for details)
